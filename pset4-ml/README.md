### Learning 

Machine learning algorithms and model evaluation. Supervised learning for classification (perceptron learning, nearest-neighbor, and k-nearest-neighbor classification) and regression (linear regression) tasks. Reinforcement learning for decision-making (Q-learning with Îµ-greedy decision making). Unsupervised learning for clustering tasks.
