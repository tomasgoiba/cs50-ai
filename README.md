## CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python
This repository contains all the projects for Harvard's [Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/), from the CS50 series. 
Below is a breakdown of the course by topic with links to the corresponding project subfolders.     

1. [**Search**](pset0-search): 
Algorithms for graph search and adversarial search problems. 

2. [**Knowledge**](pset1-knowledge): 
Knowledge representation and inference in knowledge-based agents. 

3. [**Uncertainty**](pset3-optimization): 
Probabilistic inference with uncertain evidence. 

4. [**Optimization**](pset3-optimization): 
Algorithms for optimization problems (local search, linear programming, and constraint satisfaction).

5. [**Learning**](pset4-ml): 
Machine learning algorithms for supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.

6. [**Neural Networks**](pset5-nn): 
Shallow and deep learning with neural networks.

7. [**Language**](pset6-nlp):
